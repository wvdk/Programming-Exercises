When working on real projects I tend to create lots of little test apps to get familiar with new frameworks, troubleshoot issues, try out ideas, etc. I keep all this stuff around because I occasionally find it useful to come back to. The only value I can see it providing you is as an example of how one developer likes to work.

It's a dumping ground and extremely disorganized by design. I don't recommend you use any of this for any purpose - it is not very good code.
